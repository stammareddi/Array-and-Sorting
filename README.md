# Array-and-Sorting

In this program you read an array from a file and sort the given array. The final product 
is to return an array sorted with all even numbers in ascending order followed by all odd 
numbers in descending order.To achieve this I used mergesort to sort the given array in 
order. After that I split the array into odd and even arrays, followed by reversing the odd
array and combining both the array to get the final array.
